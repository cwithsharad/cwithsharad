**NOTE: - The story is imaginary, its only for entertainment purpose, it’s a humble request to readers to be patient while reading the story. It does not have intentions to hurt anybody.**


That black night is remembered by all since the hurricane came.
The story of hurricane Agony in The Cimmerian Island in the Sea of Darkness.

This sea was famous for its nasty tricks on the sailor’s mind. The island was considered as a taboo for the peoples, for which it is a place for interest for the sailors. Many sailors had come to this island but few of them had the destiny of resurgence .
Some of the people of nearby island believed that the evil spirits are living there since the beginning of life on earth. Many of them also told that the island is a place of volcanic eruption and it has a very high temperature

........and so on. The comments of the peoples then too attracted the travellers and sailors from all over the mother earth.

There he was, the lover of adventure and treasure hunting, standing on the top of the floor of ship named Herculean, with Cigar in his mouth, adjusting the lenses of his Binocular to get a glimpse of the Cimmerian island. Sir Armin called the guide asking him to come on deck to view the island's map, he came down with a jump from the top which showed he was a lethal fighter too. Jake showed him the outline for it was the only thing they had for looking out the island. The other thing for which the Cimmerian island was famous was that many of the astrologers found that this island is at the suitable place to find the gold which must be inside the deep crust. Many of the dangerous adventures Sir Armin experienced but this time it was like a gold pebble in stones, small but worthy. As Sir Armin was observing the map carefully one of the sailor Shouted in excitement,
**"O Sir we got what we were searching for”.** Sir Armin gazed at the island but couldn't see anything except the undivided clouds surrounding the island and the thundering which could be felt from far miles away. All the sailors were shocked to see such type of Conditions prevailing around the Cimmerian Island. But in the mind of Sir Armin was something else. He decided to aim his fire arrows towards the Island and so did he. But it was too late for that day as it was soon going to be dusk.

The next day it was dawn of a new adventure for Sir. As he used to do when he started his day he took a sip of his homemade wine and shook his head with a shine in his eyes. 'Captain ' said his servant on your commands we are ready to release the fireworks with a notorious smile on his war scratched face. "Why didn’t you did it before my day begun" said the captain. Aye Sir he heard and then the sound of loading and reloading. When he came out of the small prison like room, he had a smile on his cheek. His eyes were looking at the flying death. Then there was a sound of splash in the water of the Sea of Darkness.

All the neighbouring tribes of nearby archipelagos were alert now. Their leader warned Sir Armin of the danger prevails around them but what a person could do to change the path of a hungry Lion to feed upon his meal. He ignored the bell as usual. He ordered his men to unload the boats and be prepare to witness the adventure.
He got a news from his messenger that the Island is surrounded by dense clouds since the hurricane 'Agony' came. The ancestors said that with Agony came the lord of darkness to this Island. from another world. Sir Armin was too anxious now he jumped into the boat and soon was approaching towards the Cimmerian land. The waves of the sea indicated the dangerous atmosphere prevailing around them, after hours of hard work, at last they were that much near that they could jump from their boats and reach the Cimmerian island. He ordered one of his men to put the first footprint in this island and claim it. He did what he was ordered but the thing happened to him was speechless he disappeared like wind does. All were bewildered. Sir Armin was now determined to solve this puzzle of disappearing travellers. After hours of silence and plan in his mind, he told his sailors,'' If you did not get me again on this island after a month then you shall go back and say to my family that I was Merry to be an explorer and I am merry to be an explorer and I died not in vain”. He closed his eyes and jumped on the land. What happened earlier happened now ...................he disappeared.
His sailors did as directed. first week ended in vain. Second was about to start.
Sir Armin opened his eyes and found himself in the new world. He was taken to the lord of darkness to be a satisfier of blood. The language of the soldiers who were taking him to Lord was unusual .... he didn't heard that in any of the country. He was chained by some magical power, so he was unable to play tricks and come out of them. When he entered a gigantic gate made of skulls and bones he was unable to accept this, Sir Armin was also afraid of. But not of death but the thing that if he was dead then he would be not be able to witness the extremely adventurous trips. By this we come to know that he was a brave one too. He saw a queue of souls in front of his eyes but that was not the place where he was taken, he was taken to the butcher who was tearing a man into two pieces then was draining the soul and blood and then what he got was blood, blood and blood............... He threw the remaining bones and hairs on one side and hanged the body on spikes to drain the remaining blood. Next term was of Armin. He was thrown at the butcher's feet.
And there his crew members were sleeping deep. The Island played the ill trick for which it was famous. The tenebrous mist covered the ship entirely, the sailors soon were senseless, they were asleep now unaware of the worldly affairs. They also disappeared just like their leader. Now the body of Sir Armin was about to split just when The Lord of the Darkness prevented him to do. And get some worthy drop of blood.  He the ruler asked Sir but he didn't reply, cause of her unconsciousness. He was prisoned with other prisoners.
There was something with frightened the servants of Lord. "My Lord Lynx, what's the matter that you forbade us to kill such a puny man who is not worthy of getting glimpse of yours".

Lord said "You don't know worth of him after all he is not a common man he is who made the excavations in the Fire country and got the Magic which made my ancestors to die. That magic is so mysterious and powerful that it can make a man die and then put his soul again in him. Now go and tell him that to be prepared for a fight with me so that I can hear what he has in his past memory and to make him a lethal weapon of my artillery. I can now see with my dark powers that he is the man whom I want."

Sir Armin was put in a cage like prison with some other men in it he approached to them. He said to the one near to him "Hey brother, how do you came here, did someone caught you on your way". All were looking him as if he had done some murder. The man left to him spoke" We all are here just because of our greediness and the craze of going on to an adventure”. “You see him the man in front of you is a renowned Adventurer of west. There the man in blue is a renowned poet" We all were prisoned here just to find the path of the dark magic which The Dark Lord needs to fulfil his retaliation from human for the death of his ancestors."
Armin was now realized that why is he in the prison with others. He said to himself that he will never reveal his magic which he learned, to Lynx. He came to know that Lynx can use his powers to view one's memory and to steal the knowledge of magic if someone near him uttered magic.

He was afraid now of what distraction Lynx can do if he grasped his magic which he uses like shield.

Suddenly the sound of boots of the solders was heard all closed their eyes except Sir Armin. Soldier stood in front of him like the wall, he said to Sir Armin “You .... you will have to fight with my Lord, so that he can defeat you and learn the spellbinding words of magic to make revenge."

In the mind of Armin was going the idea to protect his knowledge of magic from the malicious Lord of Darkness. Each moment he was preparing him to fight but without magic, but how .......how he would. The day passed.

It was morning but there was nothing like sunrise in the island. The guards came to him to take him to fight Lynx.

"Yeah, I am ready to face Lynx" uttered he with so much of belief. Guards opened his cage, he came out with a smile down his cheek. They gave him a push towards the path of the place of Battle of magic which Lynx used to overcome others and gain take knowledge of precious magic.

As soon as he entered the gate. Then he was hit by a sudden attack of Blow magic ........again and again. He somehow struggled to get over it but the power of Dark magic used by Lynx was going on harsher and harsher. The guards came to him and pulled him up and gave him the warning that that's the last time of him to save his life and reveal the secret of magic to him. But what a change of game, less than a second came a tremendous idea of uttering the Magic to turn anyone on this earth into ashes.

Armin with a smile on his cheek once again spoke to Lynx
a
**t** the last alphabet spiky by Armin the Dark Lord uttered the same as he uttered. And with apace was the whole of The island was free from the Dark Lord Lynx and his men. His body turned into ashes and the Sun was rising high between the clouds.
All the prisoners rushed towards the Battlefield of Magic to see who Killed the Lynx the ruler of Darkness but what the saw was ash and ash all around. Sir Armin's men rushed towards the island. The came at the battlefield but all were bewildered to see such dunes of ashes.

**" Where is he the actual man on this earth who saved our life"**


**One of his men rushed towards the ash and with tears in eyes ......tears not of sorrow but of proud...... tears of being led by such a noble man................He lifted the Cigarette Lighter of his hero Sir Armin with tears of respect. He showed it to all and Said " See this, that’s one of the most important thing which My Leader Sir Armin had. "**

**All there felt the Brave to and courage which Sir Armin had showed. He sacrificed his life without thinking about his family, friends and kinsmen, although he knew that with the turning of Lynx in ashes he will eventually turn into ash too. The magic which he spelled was one of the darkest and by using it in such a manner he proved his loyalty to God to the humanity. He will be remembered for ages to come, for decades and decades. His soul will be remembered till the universe ends.**
