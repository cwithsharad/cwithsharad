So what if I told you that there is a replacement for **WordPress**, well it is not completely true, so what is Jekyll ? You must be Knowing if you're a GitHub guy, all of us know about the simplicity and speed of the Jekyll which is powered by **Liquid** and **Markdown**.

Well according to the official website

> **Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.**

In simple words you can say that you write your content in **[Markdown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** and it is transformed into your HTML site, as per the template made by you.

Well this post which you are reading is also written in **Markdown**, a Markdown file is nothing but a file with a **.md** or **.markdown** extension and some of the **YAML** front matter. And now what the hell is this **YAML** :laughing: .
