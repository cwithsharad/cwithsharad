So what if I told you that there is a replacement for **WordPress**, well it is not completely true, so what is Jekyll ? You must be Knowing if you're a GitHub guy, all of us know about the simplicity and speed of the Jekyll which is powered by **Liquid** and **Markdown**.

Well according to the official website

> **Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.**
